Read Me file for operating Card game.

++Part 1++
       --Please compile cardGame.java, game.java, player.java, and cards.java
          **command = "javac cardGame.java game.java player.java cards.java"       		

       !!Important Note: Make sure that deck.txt is in the running folder.
  	                 This file has the cards that are needed to run the game.
		  	 If the file is not in the running folder, please download
		  	 from github

	--To start the game, run via the command"java cardGame"
           *cardGame is the "driver", this calls the game to begin

	--The game should then start and the output of games should output
	  
	   NOTE - since player 1 is using a double random algorithm and player 2
	   	  is using a random then linear algorithm. Rounds can take some time to finish

	--Once the program is done running, there will be output on the screen
  	   aswell as a output.txt that has been made.

	--Output.txt will hold the data needed for Lua part to run properly

	--Should you want to re-run the cardGame, just type in "java cardGame"
  	   The program will automaticlly delete the output.txt for the new run
  	   So you will only get the newest output

++Part 2++
       --To start the data calculation part for Lua, type in "lua checkOutput.lua"  
       --The code will output the calculations on the the screen

++Part 3++
       --A PDF file called "writeUp.pdf" be put on github for part 3 
         **In the case GL will be used to read the PDF,
	   a txt document called "writeUp.txt"
